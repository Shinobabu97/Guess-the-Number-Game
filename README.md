# Guess-the-Number-Game
This Python application asks the user to guess a random number between 1 and 100 once it has been generated at random. The program keeps track of how many tries it took the user to locate the right answer and informs them if their guess was too high or too low. Morever the user can chose to quit anytime he wants. Additionally sounds has been assigned for different feedbacks.

# Requirements and Dependencies
This program requires Python 3.x. There are no additional dependencies required.

5. At the prompt, type your guess and hit Enter.
6. Repeat until you have guessed the right number
7. When you correctly guess the number, the program prints a message of congratulations and notifies you of how many tries it took.
